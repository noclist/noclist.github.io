Weathering with You

1  1917 - Astounding. So many impossible shots and sequences. Completely weightless cinematography. I wish my life was staged and lit by Roger Deakins. It's not just a bit of tin, it's got a ribbon on it. Unkirk

2  Parasite - This might be a perfect movie. Not a single wasted moment or shot to be found here. Could be in it's own genre by itself. "Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films." BING BONG

3  The Irishman - Marty assembled his avengers. 3.5 hours and I wasn't ready for that ending. It seems sad to be a gangster. You charge with a gun, with a knife, you run. Greatfellas

4  Jojo Rabbit - Taika always knows exacly what he's doing. Thomasin McKenzie is a star. The first of 2 incredible Scarlett performances of 2019. The chilling ending. Those shoes. It turned out to be a bad time to be a nazi.

5  Marriage Story - Actors ACTING. 2/2 Scarlettts. Adam Driver can play both serious and funny.

6  Toy Story 4 - I love animation and these are always best in class. Woody and Buzz did it again. I just hope the toys can finally be happy. Forky is the hero we needed in 2019.

7  Waves - Ambitious to a fault. What an insane first half. I'm not familiar with this director or most of the cast but this was brilliant. Kelvin Harrison Jr. is the future of movies. Sterling K Brown with the ultimate Dad performance.

8  Knives Out - I suspect foul play.

9  Uncut Gems - ANYTHING IS POOSSIBBLE! Unpretentious, hilarious and endlessly watchable. Adam Sandler should do this more often. This is how he wins. 

10 The Farewell - Grandmas are the best.

   Peanut Butter Falcon
   Honey Boy

	I wish there was one more Shia film in 2019 to complete the Shia trio. I feel         	LaBeoufed

   The Art of Self Defense - This movie is aweome. Mark Zuckerberg, but with karate.
   The King - Chalamet is the next Michael Jordan.
   Booksmart - This was funny.
