spent some time with jim helping him get a sysadmin user for his pen testing
spent some more time on front end work for enrollment period and talked to Nick about some UI ideas with that, going to move forward with that today


spent the last couple of days working with figma, which is a design and prototyping tool. put together a couple small workflows for enrollment period, hopefully its something we can use for more UI work going forward.


so we were looking at the workflow for initiating a proposal and thought
why repeat all the employer information when all thats necessary to a proposal is the effective date

so heres a quick workflow example that hopefully can make this process simpler
