figma is basically a UI design and prototyping tool that will let us define a style guide, design patterns and reusable components

This can help us brainstorm the workflow for new features and potentilly reveal underlying problems with a feature before any development work has begun

This will be great for front end consistency, Can act as an interactive visual aide to shorten the feedback loop before using development resources

She was smart and funny and charming, and the best part is, she liked the boy too!

They did everything together. Movies, trips, sports and holidays.

and they ate and ate and ate!
